As someone who is always passionate for learning more about new technologies and experiencing old ones.

From those humble beginnings, he has evolved into a Software Developer who loves working with cutting edge tools and technologies, experimenting design×development×data integrations and keen to share his experience with people around the world. In his free time, he loves to enjoy a cup of coffee ☕️ , watching good movies & tv shows 👯 . He is also a backpacker who likes to go on frequent trips !
